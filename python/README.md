Folder structure of the Python Employee Scheduler implementation and how to run it.

Folder Structure:

A typical and organized folder structure for this Python application would look like this:

EmployeeScheduler/      <-- The main project directory
├── main.py             <-- The main script to run the application
├── src/                <-- Contains the core logic of the application
│   ├── input_handler.py  <-- Handles collecting employee input
│   └── scheduler.py      <-- Contains the scheduling algorithm
└── output/             <-- Contains modules for displaying output
    └── display.py        <-- Handles formatting and printing the schedule
Explanation of the Folders and Files:

EmployeeScheduler/ (Root Directory): This is the main folder that holds all the project's files and subdirectories.
main.py: This is the entry point of the Python application. When you run this file, it will orchestrate the different parts of the scheduler (input, scheduling, output).
src/ (Source Directory): This directory is used to keep the core logic of the application separate from the main execution script.
input_handler.py: This file likely contains functions responsible for getting input from the user, such as collecting employee names and their preferred shifts for each day.
scheduler.py: This file contains the main algorithm that takes the employee preferences and generates the weekly schedule, adhering to the defined rules (maximum workdays, minimum employees per shift, etc.).
output/ (Output Directory): This directory is intended for modules that handle how the application presents its results.
display.py: This file likely contains functions to format the generated schedule into a readable output that will be printed to the console.

How to Run the Python Application:

Running the Python application is generally straightforward, assuming you have Python installed on the system. Here are the steps:

Open the terminal or command prompt.

Navigate to the root directory of the project (EmployeeScheduler/) using the cd (change directory) command. For example:

Bash

cd EmployeeScheduler
Execute the main script (main.py) using the Python interpreter. The command to do this is:

Bash

python main.py
or, depending on the system's Python installation:

Bash

python3 main.py

Follow the prompts: Once the script starts, it will likely guide you through the process of entering employee information. If you've implemented the data persistence feature, it might load existing data or prompt you to add new employees. After you've provided the necessary input, the application will generate the schedule and then display it in the console according to the logic in output/display.py.

In Summary:

The Python implementation organizes the code into logical modules within the src and output directories, with main.py acting as the central execution script. To run the application, you navigate to the project's root directory in the terminal and execute the main.py file using the Python interpreter.
