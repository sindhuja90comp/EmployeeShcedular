A brief description of the Employee Scheduler project:

Project Description:

The Employee Scheduler is a small console application designed to automate the process of creating weekly work schedules for employees. It aims to streamline the assignment of employees to shifts, taking into account employee preferences and constraints like maximum workdays and minimum staffing levels.

Languages and Implementation:

Languages: The project is implemented using two programming languages: Java and Python.

Implementation:
Java Implementation: This version focuses on a structured, object-oriented approach. It defines Employee objects to represent individual employees with their preferences and uses data structures like HashMap and ArrayList to manage employee data and the schedule. The core logic involves collecting employee data, generating the schedule based on predefined rules, and outputting the final schedule to the console.
Python Implementation: This version also handles employee data and schedule generation. It uses Python's data structures (dictionaries and lists) to achieve similar functionality. The implementation is organized into modules for input handling, scheduling logic, and output display, promoting code reusability and maintainability.

Application and How It Works:

The application's core purpose is to generate an efficient and fair employee work schedule. It typically involves these steps:

Input: The application gathers information about employees, including their names and preferred shifts for each day of the week (e.g., morning, afternoon, evening)

Scheduling: The central part is the scheduling. This algorithm assigns employees to specific shifts on each day, adhering to rules such as:

In essence, the Employee Scheduler automates a time-consuming and complex task, helping businesses optimize their staffing and ensure fair distribution of work among employees.
